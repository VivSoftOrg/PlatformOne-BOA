ENBUILD UI Catalog Items


UI Catalog Items can be created using Manifest files. It uses configration rather than code to create new DevSecOps stack deployments.

This folder shows the Manifest files for AWS Landing Zone, Azure Landing Zone and Big Bang. 

The Manifest files are pointers to other repositories that store the Infrastructure and Code (IaC) and/or Configuration as Code (CaC) and the pipelines needed to deploy a software tool or service.
