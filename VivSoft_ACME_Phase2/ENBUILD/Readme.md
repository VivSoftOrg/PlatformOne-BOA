## ENBUILD is a delivery accelerator (no-license required) that automates the provisioning of highly secure, cloud-based infrastructure using open-source technologies to modernize legacy DoD (Department of Defense) mission applications in DevSecOps and Machine Learning Ops (MLOps) environments! 
 
 
It is an interface for DevSecOps Engineers to select and configure complex tech stacks from a single searchable UI. 
 
It pre-configures IaC/CaC and increases the speed and accuracy of deploying new environments and applications.

A key benefit of our design approach is treating security as a first-class citizen. For example, we simplified the creation of complex tasks such as encryption of secrets through the User Interface (UI). Security is simplified and integrated into every deployment, benefiting P1 because it prevents accidental leakage of passwords and keeps user data encrypted for complex containerized microservices applications.
