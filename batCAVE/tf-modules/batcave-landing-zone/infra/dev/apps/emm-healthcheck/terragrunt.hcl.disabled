# To test the emm-healthchheck in the development environment, copy this file to terragrunt.hcl:
#
#     cp terragrunt.hcl.disabled terragrunt.hcl
#
# You can then run terragrunt apply in this directory or terragrunt run-all apply from the
# /infra/dev directory.
#
# NOTE: To clean up the healthcheck when you are done testing you must run terragrunt destroy while
# the terragrunt.hcl file still exists. If you delete the terragrunt.hcl file, these resources will
# be skipped by subsequent calls to terragrunt destroy.
